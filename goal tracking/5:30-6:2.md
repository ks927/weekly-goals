### How'd I do?
This was a week about getting back on the right track after an abbreviated week due to illness. After Memorial Day, I really hunkered down and finished the heavy workload of Hartl tutorials, and began "rolling my auth" with the second project in the Authentication section of TOP. I'm starting to feel like I need to continue my learning at an internship or an entry level position. I will continue scouring the web for startups and internship opportunities in my area in the weeks to come.
