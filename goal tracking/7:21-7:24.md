### How'd I do?
This week I got done most of what I intended, but realized I have much more of the mountain left to climb than I previously thought. I finished the Flight Booker app and am proud of the finished product, but I think it would be more professional with a full test suite. This can be said for each of the Rails projects on my portfolio. I wrote a personalized cover letter for a company I applied for, which took me nearly a full day, so I hope it doesn't take that long for every company I want to apply to. I also think I need to be grinding leetcode/CTCI algorithms after all in preparation for interviews.
