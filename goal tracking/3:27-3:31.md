### How'd I do?
I believe this was the first week since I began TOP that I didn't have a project to complete, but it turned out to be one of the more productive weeks for me. I got a few Readme's done that desperately needed completing, deepened my understanding of Git, and began the Rails section of the curriculum. On top of all of that, it was the best gym/physical health week I've had in a very long time. I will try to keep the momentum going into the Rails projects, which I'm sure will slow me down again.
