### How'd I do?
This week turned out to be a cornerstone week for me, and one that hopefully I will look back on as a turning point in my career. After finishing up the Private Events app, writing about it, and adding it to my portfolio, I decided to take a shot in the dark and apply to a few startups on Angel List. Within an hour I got a message back and had a phone screen later that day. Although it remains to be seen whether anything will come of it, the confidence boost alone has shown me that perhaps I am ready to enter the work force. Time to really grind some leetcode problems.
