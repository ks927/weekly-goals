### How'd I do?
The week began with President's Day, so I needed to try and a cram a lot into the remaining four days. I completely underestimated the difficulty of the web server project, and it took me the majority of three days to finish. The increased time spent on that meant less time spent on physical fitness. Computer science concepts this week are not long but could be challenging.
