### How'd I do?
This was the first week in as long as I can remember that progressing with The Odin Project's curriculum was not my main priority. I tried and succeeded in writing a personal cover letter and applying to one job everyday. Additionally, I wanted to make a couple projects more presentable by fleshing out their test suites, which I started but still need to work on. I found a site that walks-through dozens of interview DS&A problems in Ruby that will be invaluable to me. After all of this, I began work on the APIs section of TOP.
