### How'd I do?
Easter week turned out to be a pretty successful one although it started out with a lot of frustration. Converting my command line hangman game to a Sinatra app was a much more difficult task than the random number guesser or the caesar cipher. But once that was done, I finally got to jump into Rails with another Hartl tutorial. Unlike the blog app from the web dev 101 section, this tutorial actually explained what was happening along the way, so now I have an understanding of what is going on with the Rails file directory. Finally, I finished up the week writing a long blog post about the app and explaining the MVC flow it follows.
