### How'd I do?
Implemented a spell checker in CS50 this week which was very challenging but pretty cool. Among other things, the class is making me think differently about how to plan code for an efficient solution. Instead of jumping head first into coding like I've largely been able to do up until now, I need to draw out on paper what the computer is doing, then write the steps in pseudocode, finally trying to the comment the steps in the IDE before actually coding the program. I believe I'm going to begin work on a company website soon using wordpress.com or more likely wordpress.org and self-hosting.
