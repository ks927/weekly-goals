### How'd I do?
The week started out ok as I finished the knight's travails problem, albiet with a good deal of help from other student solutions. Next I moved onto the TDD lesson and grasped the beginner concepts pretty easily. However, the more advanced syntax seems to be left out of the study materials and I haven't been able to wrap my head around it as yet. That will certainly be priority #1 moving forward into next week.
