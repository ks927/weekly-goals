### How'd I do?
The projects at the end of the Rails course are becoming more complicated and much more time consuming. Additionally, with summer here, I'm having to choose between code and spending time with family/friends on vacation. This past week, however, I completely redid my website so that it is fit for showing employer, but I may wait until I finish this Private Events project I'm working on. The week ahead looks to be busy one, though.
