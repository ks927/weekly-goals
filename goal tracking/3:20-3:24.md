### How'd I do?
Gave myself a check for completing the Testing project although I'm still working on getting the tests to pass for my connect four game. I am feeling very accomplished that I was able to build the game, however, especially since it took me the better part of three days to put together. I also got my tests to pass for the tic tac toe game rather easily once I figured out what I was doing wrong. As a side note, I've settled into a comfortable routine with my diet and workout plan.
