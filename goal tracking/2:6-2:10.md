### How'd I do?
I'm going to need to dig in and bounce back after this past week. A mid-week funeral on Staten Island, work calling me in for extra hours, and a Super Bowl hangover meant the first full week of February was my least productive thus far. Despite these struggles, I made decent strides in my Ruby OOP learning - building a command line tic-tac-toe game from scratch.
