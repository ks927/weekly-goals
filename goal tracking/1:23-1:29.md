[x]Complete Web Development 101 course on TOP

### How'd I do?
A week dominated by two TOP projects saw me ultimately complete my goal of finishing the Web Development 101 course by Saturday evening. The first was the combined Ruby basics and Test Driven Development challenge. The second was the Ruby on Rails blog app. Both provided their difficulties, but they were still more introductory-level assignments. The days to come will be filled with the meat and potatoes of the curriculum, so my goals will consist of more motivation-type tasks.
