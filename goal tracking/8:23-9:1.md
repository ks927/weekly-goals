### How'd I do?
This was a frustrating week regarding the Facebook project because I spent 2 full days trying to get the ajax to work for liking posts. I persevered and it is mostly working now. I'm starting to hit DS&As harder and am getting more curious about computer science in general, but really need to finish off this project before digging fully into something else.
