### How'd I do?
I have completely immersed myself into The Odin Project, and I can see what people mean when they say that coding takes over their lives. I eat, sleep, and breathe code. Whenever I am not working on something or learning something new, I feel like I am wasting time. Still trying to figure out if this is good or bad. This week I built an etch-a-sketch program using HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery of which I am very proud, and then moved on to begin learning the Ruby language. I am spending less and less time on the blog, but someday I will probably make it nice and presentable.
