### How'd I do?
I completed the pset4 for CS50 but I don't think I would've been able to do it without watching a walkthrough of the answer on youtube. I'm not sure if it's just the C language I'm having trouble with or what exactly is being asked or both. I desperately want to learn lower level computer science so my struggles with the homework have been somewhat discouraging. This week I also updated my Sinatra Hangman project and command line Connect Four game in order to be more presentable on my portfolio. Nothing but rejection emails thus far though.
