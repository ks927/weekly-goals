### How'd I do?
After an initial bout of what might have been beginner's luck with applying, I havent heard back from the two companies with whom I made contact with in my first week of applications. So this week I got to work on completing another project for my portfolio/resume, and it proved more time consuming than I planned. Hopefully I can finish it up and polish it off with enough time to send out some fresh apps in the upcoming week. I'd also like to write a blog post about it as well.
