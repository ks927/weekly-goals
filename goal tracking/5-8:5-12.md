### How'd I do?
I don't know if it's because summer is quickly approaching or because my savings are running out, but I'm suddenly feeling a greater urgency to land the plane and start looking for employment. So this past week I scrapped my WordPress idea and created my own personal website from scratch, and I like it a lot better. I have no idea if I'm ready for employers to take me seriously because my projects just seem so elementary, but I'm going to keep working on improving the site as I progress through the Rails section of TOP in hopes that I can add some more complexity to my portfolio. I've also recently gotten into eating more calories and lifting more. Maybe I'm trying to grow my body to keep up with my mind.
