### How'd I do?
My pace is slowing down tremendously as I near the end of the Ruby section of TOP. There are less chapters/materials to read and more practice problems and projects to complete that take days to finish. I'm finding that I'm rarely able to figure out things on my own anymore, but almost always need to consult previous student's answers. This is pretty discouraging but I make sure I study the thought process and write about it on Fridays to make sure I have complete comprehension. I've started a healthy diet plan, as well as focused a bit more on my workouts.
