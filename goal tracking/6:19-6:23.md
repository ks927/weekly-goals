### How'd I do?
My family had a place at the beach this week, but I only stayed down for a night and a day, so I was able to dedicate a good amount of the week to studying. Unfortunately, the Private Events project took up the lionshare of my time, and I didn't even finish it until the week was over. But it should serve as a good example on my portfolio, and hopefully I can start getting my name out there in the next week.
