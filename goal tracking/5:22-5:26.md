### How'd I do?
This week was completely de-railed by a violent stomach virus I came down with on Thursday morning that lasted through until Friday evening. It's disappointing because I was building momentum in the Rails section and needed to get through a decent amount of the Hartl tutorials before the abbreviated Memorial Day week. I'm going to need to hunker down this upcoming week to regain my footing.
