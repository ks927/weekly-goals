### How'd I do?
As far as completing goals that I set for myself, this week I fell short of hitting the marks. I can attribute this to two main sources. 1. My work schedule has changed to working more in the afternoons instead of the mornings - meaning I have less time on Mondays and Wednesdays to spend studying. 2. I got deeper into the Sinatra section of TOP's curriculum, and got a little stuck. I spent an entire day trying to convert my Hangman game into a Sinatra app to no avail, so I'll have to figure out the ins and outs of that to start this next week.
