### How'd I do?

The chaos of the holidays was finally over and my work and study habits were in need of some restoration. I'll give myself a bit of a pass because it was  a three-day weekend, but I definitely got back to coding as opposed to working so much on the blog. I learned the node tutorial and design patterns reading are going to be ongoing proccesses. There's just too much there to knock out in a sitting. Also, I continued grappling with the idea of a bootcamp.
