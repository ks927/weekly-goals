### How'd I do?
This week was sort of a like a reality check week for me. The first couple projects in the basic Ruby section were extremely challenging and frustrating, and made me question whether I should be doing this or not. Of course those doubts were only fleeting, and I know the frustrations are part of the process. I just hope that as I progress, some of these tribulations pay off with more confidence going into assignments.
