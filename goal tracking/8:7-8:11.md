### How'd I do?
(Writing this 2 weeks later) I've missed my first week monitoring my weekly progress, but that isn't due to lack of motivation. I've been caught up in trying to complete my Facebook clone/learning algorithms and data structures. Everything else has been shelved until I complete my fully tested Facebook project. Aside from learning more computer sciency stuff that is.
