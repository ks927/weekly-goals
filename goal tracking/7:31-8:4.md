### How'd I do?
With my priorities more spread out, I began to feel overwhelmed and stress this week. This made me realize the importance of focusing on one task at a time. I completed the API project and began work on the final project in the Rails section - a Facebook clone. The job search continues, and I'm considering going back to school.
