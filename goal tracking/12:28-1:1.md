### How'd I do?

This was my first week I thought I'd try organizing my learning using Una Kravets's personal goals repository. The checklist was motivational and made me feel accomplished, and it kept me a little more on track. However, it being the week between Christmas and New Year's was probably not a good indicator of my usual work ethic. Hopefully I can keep it up and I look forward to seeing what I can accomplish on more "normal" weeks.
