### How'd I do?
The facebook project has everything it needs to be a presentable portfolio project. However, I'm still wrestling with the Ajax for some of the features. CS50 homework is getting very challenging, which I'm a little nervous about going forward, but the topics are captivating me and I love learning this stuff. I need to get back on the job hunt.
