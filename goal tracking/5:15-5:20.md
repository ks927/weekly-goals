### How'd I do?
I put two new pieces of the puzzle together this week. First, I built a not-so-much Reddit clone to practice setting up associations between a model and database. Next, I put together a re_former app to learn about forms and how user input interacts with the controller. I did no work on my site or on looking at jobs/internships, unfortunately, other than voraciously reading r/cscareerquestions. I started a new fitness plan and am trying to eat more calories to gain weight. During the week ahead, I am meeting with a friend to do some paired coding. I'm excited to see where that leads.
