### How'd I do?
This past week I implemented commenting and tests, and an update user info section to my facebook clone. In the upcoming week, I'm hopeful that I can finish off the last couple base features I want and that deployment goes smoothly. I also need to work on DS&A and get back to applying for jobs.
