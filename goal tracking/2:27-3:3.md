### How'd I do?
It was another week of struggling with complex concepts, but I survived and learned a ton. My progress has definitely slowed, which is to be expected considering the difficulty of the material, but I can't help but feel a little discouraged at times. I think going forward, I'm going to attempt to not sacrifice physical fitness or diet for coding. We'll see how that goes this upcoming week.
