### How'd I do?
The two highlights of this week were 1. I began work on my personal website and 2. I attended my first tech meetup. WordPress is still foreign to me - so far I hate it - so I need to figure out how to customize their templates enough to make them not so obviously WordPress. The meetup, Philly.rb, was great. It seems like a great way to network, and I can't wait to attend more soon, whether they be Philly.rb or just other tech meetups in general. I'm slowly but surely progressing through the Rails lessons, and absorbing the information as I go.
