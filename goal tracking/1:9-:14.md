### How'd I do?

I started off the week asking r/learnprogramming and r/learnjavascript about on-site vs. online bootcamps. The discussion I sparked in r/learnjavascript led to me ferociously pursuing The Odin Project's curriculum for the rest of the week, and I hope to keep it up through the entire syllabus. I added a fitness goal so that I wouldn't lose track of my health outside of coding, and it worked to great effect. I will continue this in coming weeks.
