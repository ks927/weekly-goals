### How'd I do?
I accomplished all I wanted to this week plus got back into solving problems on Code Wars. It helped that week 6 and 7 of CS50 were just lectures with no problem sets. I've converted my github.io blog to wordpress and am in the process of finishing up moving the posts over. I want to get back into blogging because it really helps my understanding and I've learned so much since my last entry. Starting to get some bites on applications.
