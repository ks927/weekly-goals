### How'd I do?
With the 4th of July on a Tuesday, this left me with only three serious days of study (two really because of work). Within those days, I tried to do things to help make myself more employable. With possible future interviews coming up, I overhauled my resume to emphasize my projects and technical skills. I also began researching common Ruby developer interview questions which I will continue to do in the coming weeks.
