### How'd I do?
I didn't really work on the site this past week, mainly because I'm so unimpressed with WordPress. I really should get over it and plug away at it because it's probably my best, if not only, shot at employment. I was all set to attend the "Software as Craft" meetup on Tuesday night but it was pouring rain, and I didn't want to have to walk through the city in that kind of weather. I was bummed out, but it afforded me more time to work on TOP things. I completed the next project and am entrenched in learning SQL at the moment. Moving forward, I need to work on the portfolio site or at the very least make my GitHub more presentable.
