### How'd I do?
This was actually one of the most annoying weeks I've had in recent memory. Although I finished the Members Only app early on and read the sections leading up to the next project, I decided to put some finishing touches on the app before starting a new one. I spent the better part of two days just trying to figure out how to import my local database to Heroku. I'm glad I didn't give up because I got it working in the end, and now it looks and functions professionally, and will serve as a portfolio piece. Aside from that I spent a three day weekend in Boston so it was a shortened week.
