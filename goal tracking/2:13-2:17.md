### How'd I do?
Coming into the week I said that I needed a bounce-back week, and I feel I definitely delivered on this goal. Although the goal of finishing both the Intermediate and On the Web Ruby courses may have proved overly ambitious, completing the Hangman game was my largest and most challenging project to date. The shortened week coming up will require sharpened focus and even greater time dedication than I have given thus far.
