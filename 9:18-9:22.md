### How'd I do?
With the Facebook project looking and behaving more professionally, I decided to try again at job applications. I've only a pplied to a few thus far but will continue and hopefully ramp up the numbers in the coming weeks. CS50 is getting very tough. I completed week 3 but have been stuck on week 4 for some time. Although the concepts are still intriguing and I'm more or less absorbing them, the homework problems are a bit over my head.
